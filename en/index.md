## What is its main purpose and scope of application?

The main task that the technology solves is to accelerate software development through the use of innovative constructor technologies, a ready-made set of widgets and modules, as well as AI that helps programmers create efficient programs. This is especially useful for startups, allowing them to develop more projects in the same time and budget.

BayLang Technology is a powerful tool for accelerated software development, combining a programming language, cloud infrastructure, a visual constructor, and artificial intelligence.

The technology provides unique capabilities for creating and deploying web applications, CRM systems, and mobile solutions with minimal time costs.


## Unified Technology Stack

The key advantage of BayLang Technology is the unification of all development levels into a single framework.

Technology levels:
1. Programming language
2. Web framework, libraries
3. Set of ready-made blocks, widgets, plugins
4. Visual programming constructor
5. Artificial intelligence for software development

BayLang Technology covers all five levels of the technology stack, which distinguishes it favorably from solutions like React, Laravel, and Node.js, which focus only on the second level.

In the following sections, I will tell you more about each of these levels.


## Level 1. BayLang Programming Language

Task: Provide cross-platform software development.

Cross-platform capability is the ability of a program to work on different platforms (PHP, JS, Node.js, WordPress, Laravel, Java, C#, x86-64, ARM, etc.)

The main idea is automatic conversion of the program to code in other languages. Currently, PHP, JavaScript, and NodeJS are supported.

This allows developing application code using a single codebase.

This is especially useful for web application development, when backend and frontend work on different technologies, such as PHP+JS or Python+JS.

Programmers can develop both frontend and backend in a single BayLang language, which will automatically convert the program code to PHP and JS. This simplifies business processes related to software development, improves hiring, staff training, and system maintenance.

Converting programs to different programming languages allows creating cross-platform applications.


## Level 2. BayLang Web Framework

The BayLang web framework provides a rich set of tools and functions for developing modern web applications.

It includes the following capabilities:

|   | Features | Specifications |
|---|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Routing and HTTP request processing | Allows effective management of incoming requests and directing them to the required handlers |
| 2 | Data exchange bus | Facilitates communication between components and microservices of the application |
| 3 | API work | Simplifies integration with frontend and external systems |
| 4 | Template engine and MVC | Structures the project and separates logic from presentation |
| 5 | Basic widgets | Accelerates user interface development |
| 6 | Dependency Injection | Provides flexibility and modularity of the application |
| 7 | Error handling | Improves reliability through centralized error management |
| 8 | ORM, database work | Simplifies interaction with databases |
| 9 | DB migrations | Allows easy management of database structure changes |
| 10 | Unit testing | Ensures code quality and reliability |


## Level 3. Ready-made Blocks Set and Plugin System

Most modern frameworks, such as Laravel, React, Django, mainly work at the second level and provide tools for routing, database work, templating.

Many of them have ecosystems with packages and plugins (such as packages on npm, composer, pip), which can also be considered as the “third level.”

The problem is that these packages are not always standardized and are often created by different developers without strict integration. This complicates development and requires additional costs and resources for their integration.

**BayLang’s advantage in component and module unification and standardization**

BayLang provides ready-made blocks that integrate at the framework core level as additional modules. Their development is handled by the main BayLang developer team, which ensures their compatibility and support.

Unification allows avoiding problems associated with using third-party packages that may be incompatible with each other. In BayLang, all blocks are tested and guaranteed to work together.

This makes life easier for developers, as they spend less time “gluing” disparate components and can focus on business logic.

For example, using ready-made blocks in BayLang allows implementing typical functions - such as authentication, admin panel, and CRUD interfaces - in a matter of hours, while on traditional frameworks this can take days or weeks.

Or, when creating an online store, typical blocks such as cart, personal account, and product catalog can be easily integrated.

This saves time, reduces errors, decreases technical debt, and lowers maintenance costs.

Using ready-made blocks allows programmers to focus on business logic rather than basic functionality development.

Currently, BayLang supports the following modules:
- JWT-based authentication
- Admin panel
- Widget system
- Gallery widget
- Components (Button, Text, Label, Link, Menu, Tree)
- Input fields (Input, Select, TextArea)
- Code editor CodeEditor
- Dialog windows
- Forms and tables
- Email message delivery

Planned development:
- Website code generation using AI
- Integration with WooCommerce, trading accounting systems
- Landing Page blocks
- Product catalog and shopping cart
- Personal account


## What does SMB need?

Small and medium business (SMB) strives to develop websites and ERP systems quickly and with minimal costs.

To achieve this goal, ready-made solutions or visual programming systems are needed. About 80% of the code can be implemented as plugins and used within RAD (Rapid Application Development).

Experience using WordPress shows that websites can be created using an existing set of plugins.

BayLang technology has been tested on WordPress and adds:
- modern web framework
- routing
- database work through ORM
- reactivity capabilities
- integration with VueJS

This improves website code quality, making it more modern, maintainable, and scalable.

Additionally, BayLang can be used to develop CRM and ERP systems, offering quick solutions for typical business tasks.


## Level 4. Visual Programming Constructor

Visual programming is becoming an integral part of modern software development.

BayLang offers a constructor that allows programmers to concentrate more on application architecture rather than coding.

The constructor allows:
- Connecting ready-made blocks to create an application
- Directly editing source code in BayLang language
- Making changes both through the constructor and manually
- Working with code and using visual tools simultaneously

Features:
- Mouse-based program code development
- FullStack development (Frontend and Backend)
- Library of ready-made widgets
- PHP and JavaScript support
- Font loading capability
- Built-in code editor
- Work with forms, gallery, mail system
- DB migrations and project management

BayLang constructor facilitates development and accelerates the change implementation process, providing flexibility for experienced programmers.


## Level 5. Vibecoding and Artificial Intelligence

Vibecoding is a modern trend where AI helps in software development.

IMO, AI should not generate program code from scratch. Modern attempts to generate code lead to AI being unable to fully generate code.

Current large language models (LLMs) often make syntax and logic errors or make many mistakes during generation. Their strength lies in fixing or supplementing small code snippets and generating configurations.

AI for software development should use the constructor to create programs from ready-made components, set up each module, and establish relationships between program elements.

Using such a software development model allows:
- Easier AI training for programming and creating higher quality programs
- Reduced error count since each component is already tested
- Code reuse, ready templates, and libraries
- Easier test automation

Development speed increases because AI doesn’t have to invent basic things or develop code from scratch.

As a result, we get higher quality programs.

When AI assembles applications from verified blocks, the probability of critical errors is lower. Ready modules can be tested with unit tests, which reduces debugging workload.

BayLang applies exactly this approach. It’s planned to train AI to completely create programs according to technical specifications, not just make code corrections.

BayLang Technology offers:
- Standardized components and module library with clear API
- Each block will contain metadata and documentation so AI understands how to use it
- BayLang programming language and framework with high abstraction level
- Visual code editor for programmers
- Capability for programmers to develop their own blocks, modules, and components and integrate them with AI


## Resume

BayLang Technology is a comprehensive solution for software development, combining all stages in a single technology stack. Thanks to unified blocks, visual programming, and AI support, the platform allows rapid application creation with fewer errors and lower costs.

We strive to change the approach to development, making it faster, more accessible, and convenient for programmers.

In the long term, this could become a new standard for software development using AI.
