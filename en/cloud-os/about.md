## Concept of Cloud OS

BAYRELL Cloud OS is an **open-source cloud operating system** that allows installing cloud applications and various software from different marketplaces into a single cloud ecosystem using virtual spaces.

Cloud OS allows you to **deploy your own cloud** based on Docker Swarm and manage it through a web interface.

In short, the **key idea** of the cloud OS is to assemble various integrated builds into **a single cloud ecosystem from a set of ready-made software**. There can be an unlimited number of such builds. Each build solves certain tasks and consists of a specific set of software and components that solve these tasks as qualitatively as possible. Cloud builds are created by cloud integrators.

The second key idea is the automatic generation of yaml files and **installing programs through the web interface**. This is implemented through templates and modifiers. The template is created by the software developer or by someone who assembles the docker container for the Cloud OS. The template contains instructions: how to run the application and what parameters it will have.


## Areas of Application

- cloud IDE systems for software development;
- version control system;
- cloud digital repository of source code for IT companies;
- automation of CI/CD processes;
- corporate business systems, CRM, ERP;
- web hosting management systems;
- IoT devices;
- smart home systems;
- etc


## Advantages of BAYRELL Cloud OS

**Creating a Personal Cloud**

Using the Docker Swarm system, the cloud operating system allows combining servers into a single digital space and installing applications with one click. The list of available applications is available in the <a href="https://baylang.com/en/marketplace" target="_blank">Marketplace</a>.

**No Vendor Lock**

You can choose a server provider and decide where to get hosting. At any time, you can change the provider and move the cloud there.

**Ability to Run Services on Your Own Servers**

With the cloud OS, you can be independent of SaaS systems and launch a personal cloud on your own servers, integrating the necessary cloud software. This way you can independently manage your company’s data and not depend on the geopolitical situation in the world and the operation of the global Internet. You can put your own server even in the company’s office and have direct access to the system and data stored there.

**Ability to Work Without Internet**

When running the cloud OS on Raspberry Pi, after installation and configuration, the system will work locally and can work without the Internet. The Internet will be needed to update the system or synchronize data with the cloud.

**Distribution of Cloud Software Through Marketplace**

The Cloud OS can work with multiple software repositories and decentralized repositories. Vendor companies, software developers, can launch their own app stores, thereby managing sales and setting their own sales rules for the software they developed.

**Cloud Software Licensing**

The cloud OS contains a mechanism for licensing cloud software, which is developed by the vendor company. Licenses allow control over the sale of Cloud Software. Distribution of licenses and cloud software is carried out through the vendor company’s own marketplace.

**Unified Ecosystem for Cloud Software**

The cloud operating system integrates software and creates a single window for using and managing it. One window, one URL address, login and password. You no longer need to switch between different systems. You get a centralized integrated build that solves your problems and is easier to manage.

The main difference from a SaaS solution is that for business you need to connect several SaaS solutions. When there is one SaaS, this is convenient. But when there are many SaaS systems, about 10, this ceases to be convenient, because there become 10 such systems, and a single management window is lost. Using the cloud OS, you can assemble a build on one server or cloud, so instead of 10 different components, you will have one integrated system that works as a single complex.

**Creation of Integration Cloud Builds for Various Niches**

The cloud operating system allows creating integration builds by reusing other already developed applications. Instead of developing a system from scratch, with the cloud OS you can install ready-made software as components, integrate them with each other, and get a solution for your business. The cost of developing such a solution is many times less than developing your own.

**Web Hosting Control Panel**

The cloud OS can be used for personal server management. OS has a web panel through which you can place developed sites on servers and manage them.


## Business Model

**Cloud Software** - software developed to work in the Cloud (various ERP systems, CRM, CMS, cloud storage, smart home systems, etc.)

**Docker** - System for delivering Cloud Software to the end consumer.

**Vendors** - companies that develop software for the Cloud OS using the docker system.

**Integration Build** - Cloud Software that consists of several Cloud Software integrated with each other and represents a single system or service. Usually the tasks of integration builds are complex and represent solutions for digitization of business processes, while Cloud Software digitizes only part of business processes. An integration build is a comprehensive solution for a specific field or niche. The integration build is maximally adapted to specific business processes in the niche. Often, different builds are created for different niches, which may use the same Cloud Software. An integration build can run as a boxed version or as a SaaS service on the Internet.

**Cloud Integrators** - companies that develop integration builds and provide their solution as a boxed version or SaaS service.

**Cloud OS** - this is a platform that provides Cloud Software as a service and allows creating integration builds as a service on this platform. Different vendors can upload their software to the cloud OS and sell licensed copies or rent them out through the platform. The Cloud OS should have server IaaS infrastructure to deploy the Cloud OS or integration build for each corporate client. It should also have its own marketplace where different vendors upload their software.


## Work Scheme

<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t_xEG0CTqux2kg058IpCqes_xlibIo81jA_i2w3Zr-o/" target="_blank">Presentation of Cloud OS</a>

An integration build is assembled by integrating Cloud Software written by different vendors. An integration build can work as a boxed version or as a service on the Internet. The integration build is segmented for a specific niche or tasks. Cloud Software is maximally adapted to the processes of this niche.

The cloud integrator takes on the functions of the sales department, technical support for users and server maintenance. Vendor companies take on the functions of software development and receive royalty payments for their program code, which is part of the integration build.

**Benefits for vendors** are that they don’t need to worry about the sales department, technical support and working with customers. They focus purely on development, while earning from royalties and license sales of their software, which is part of integration builds. Vendors can conclude contracts and work with several cloud integrators at once, thereby dramatically increasing the volume of sales of the software they developed. The staff of the vendor company mainly consists of programmers.

**Benefits for cloud integrators** are that they don’t spend capital costs on software development, but pay royalties on sales. Thus, they don’t need large financial investments in developing a large system, but simply need to find companies that already have the necessary software developed, conclude contracts with them and work together with them on an integration solution. And pay royalties on service sales.

It is especially worth noting the fact that assembling an integration build is much simpler, cheaper and faster than developing it from scratch. Considering that usually a build consists of several large modules and subsystems, and the development of such systems can take years. When an assembly can be put together much faster.

Thus, Cloud OS is an anti-crisis solution in the field of developing large IT systems that deal with digitization and automation of business processes and cross-processes.

## Virtual Spaces (Cabinets) System

Each corporate client in the Cloud OS can create their own virtual space and combine Cloud Software (services) in this single cabinet. Data from different subsystems of the integration build will be collected in a single window. Access to this data will be provided through a single domain or mobile application.
